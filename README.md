# credit-risk-model-project
This project focuses on building a robust Credit Risk Modelling pipeline to assess the likelihood of default for loan applicants. Using a combination of statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions by evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals.

üìå Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, feature engineering)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights

Model building using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Model evaluation using ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost)

Jupyter Notebook
